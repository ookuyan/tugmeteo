TÜBİTAK National Observatory (TUG) Meteorology Library

A library where instant and historical meteorological data can be obtained.

TUBITAK National Observatory (TUG) is located at an altitude of 2500 m, on the
top of Bakirlitepe mountain in Saklikent region of the city of Antalya
which is located on the Mediterranian coast of Türkiye. It resides in a
longitudinally important region, because there is no other active observatory
along and around this longitude on which TUG is located. Besides it fills a
significant gap, on the map from far east to the west of Europe. It deserves
to point out that the Observatory site is exceptionally good in terms of
climatologic conditions.
